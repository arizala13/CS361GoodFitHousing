		<h2>Co-housing</h2>
		<p style="width: 700px">

			are closer in way that makes the yards smaller. This will mean less work for you and more time to spend with
			your friends and neighbors. These communities are for those who are 55+. They typically offer
			basic amenities and mainly focus on activities that help the community connect.
