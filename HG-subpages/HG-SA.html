		<h2>Senior Apartments</h2>
		<p style="width: 850px">
			Senior apartments are typically offered to those that are 55+. Where they differ compared to 55+
			type of homes or facilities is that they offer more accessibility and are for those that are less active.
			Some seniors prefer these over standard apartments because they are always kept in mind. There will be more
			handicap accessible units and features such as handrails in bathroom. These apartments do not have
			features like social activities, housekeeping or medical care. These types of facilities offer low level of care.

			<h3><strong>What are Senior Apartments?</strong></h3>
			<p>
				Senior living apartments are designed with aging residents in mind to accommodate their typical needs. 
				Senior apartments may restrict residents according to age, typically requiring residents to be at least
				55 years old. The two most important features of senior apartments are accessibility and a sense of community.
				Other features include no/limited stairs, handicap accessibility, handrails in the bathrooms, and more.<br>

			<h3><strong>Why Choose Senior Apartments?</strong></h3>
			<p>
				There are many reasons to choose a senior apartment over another housing choice. Senior apartments are similar
				to 55+ communities in the sense that they provide a space for similarly-aged people to live and form a
				community with. Since senior apartments are not quite as hands-on as a nursing home or assisted living, those
				who are looking to live in them should be relatively self-sufficient.<br><br>
				Some types of people suited for senior apartments include, but are not limited to: <br>
			</p>
