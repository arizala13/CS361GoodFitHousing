		<h2>55+ Homes</h2>
		<p style="width: 850px">
			Are you ready to downsize your house and spend more time with your neighbors? A 55+ community may be
			for you. These types of communities are often made up of individuals or couples that are
			self-sufficient, but like the idea of being within a community of people like themselves. These communities
			often have amenities like social activities, golf, security, etc. 55+ communities tend to be close to shopping
			centers as well as libraries and churches. These can be townhouses, homes or apartments.
