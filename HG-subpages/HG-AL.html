		<h2>Assisted Living</h2>
		<p style="width: 700px">
			Assisted living facilities offer 24 hour assistance, although it's a bit less involved than what would
			be seen in a nursing home. These facilities do not have medical services such as on-call nurses or doctors.
			Services available for these type of facilities include laundry, social activities, assistance with
			bathing/toileting/dressing, medication assistance, security, and emergency calls.
