			Do you feel more comfortable with 24 hour assistance for you or your loved one? Then an assisted
			living facility may be the best option for you. These facilities have more features included than
			independent living or assisted living, including 24 hour assistance with day-to-day activities,
			medical care by nurses, therapists, housekeeping, and doctors on call. Condition specific
			care is also available in these facilities.

			<h3><strong>What is a Nursing Home?</strong></h3>
			<p>
				Nursing homes are living facilities intended for people who require 'round-the-clock care.
				These facilities often include advanced on-site medical care, physical therapy, and social
				activities. They are mainly for elderly people who don't need to be in a hospital, but are
				unable to be cared for at home. Often, nursing homes are set up like households, with small
				groups of residents living under the same roof, sharing meals and activities.<br>
			</p>

			<br>
			<h3><strong>Why Choose a Nursing Home?</strong></h3>
			<p>
				The main reason to choose a nursing home over any other form of senior care is if the resident
				absolutely requires 24/7 care. Nursing homes are not hospice, but their residents are almost
				always completely dependent on on-site carers and nurses to complete their day-to-day activities.
				A person would be well-suited a nursing home if they have dementia / Alzheimer's.<br>
